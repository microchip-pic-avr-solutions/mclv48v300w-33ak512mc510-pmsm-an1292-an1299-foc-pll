    <p align="left">
     <img  src="images/ideprojectsetup.png" width="350"></p>
 

3. Open <code>**mc1_user_params.h** </code> (**pmsm.X > Header Files**) in the project **pmsm.X.**  
     - Ensure the macro <code>**OPEN_LOOP_FUNCTIONING</code>** is **undefined**
          <p align="left"><img  src="images/openloop.png" width="300"></p>
     - **Dual-Shunt Current Measurement Configuration**
          - By default, the firmware is configured to use the phase currents measured across the phase shunt resistors on two of the half-bridges of the three-phase inverter (**‘dual shunt configuration’**) to implement FOC. Ensure the macro <code>**SINGLE_SHUNT</code>** is **undefined** to run the motor in **‘dual-shunt configuration’**
               <p align="left"><img  src="images/dualshunt.png" width="300"></p>
     - **Single-Shunt Current Measurement Configuration**
          - The motor phase currents can be reconstructed from the DC Bus current by appropriately sampling it during the PWM switching period, called as **single-shunt current reconstruction algorithm**. The firmware can be configured to demonstrate the **'single-shunt configuration'** by **defining** the macro <code>**SINGLE_SHUNT**</code>
               <p align="left"><img  src="images/singleshunt.png" width="300"></p>

     - Firmware is configured to run with Hurst DMA0204024B101 Motor(Hurst300 or Long Hurst-[AC300022](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/AC300022)) by default. **Define** the macro to **MOTOR 2** to run with Hurst DMB0224C10002 Motor(Hurst075 or Short Hurst-[AC300020](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/AC300020)),or **define** the macro to **MOTOR 3** to run with Leadshine Servo Motor [(ELVM6020V24FH-B25-HD)](https://www.leadshine.com/product-detail/ELVM6020V24FH-B25-HD.html).
